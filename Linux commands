++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Configure User Resource Limits   +++++++++++++++++++++

The resource limits are defined in /etc/security/limits.conf file.
There are 2 types of limits:

(i) : Hard limit: set by admin and cannot be changed
(ii): Soft limit: can be adjusted by user upto the hard limit

File format : 

(i)  :   Domain -> User/group/wildcards
(ii) :  Type  -> Hard/soft limit
(iii): Item -> Memory size, file size, number of files
(iv) :  Value -> Limit, either by numeric value or size in kb

NOTE : User Limit takes priority over group limits
To see limit defined for user, go to that user by typing su <username> and then type ulimit -a


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Manage User Privilages   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The user privilages are difined in /etc/security/access.conf

Entry Format:
(i)  : Permissions (+ or -) grant or deny access
(ii) : User can be a user, group or ALL
(iii): Point of origin could be hostname, domain-name, IP address, IP Subnet or ALL


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Networking   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

cat /etc/os-release                         ==>   To see OS release

The Networking info is kept in 
/etc/network
/etc/network/interfaces
/etc/network/interfaces.d

To set interface to use static ip:

cd /etc/network/interfaces.d                ==>   Go inside that directory
ls -al                                      ==>   List all contents of that directory

In the directory there will be a .cfg file present. Open the file using vim and then :
--> Replace dhcp with static
--> give static ip address
--> give subnet
--> give gateway
--> give dns-nameservers (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) (most common google dns servers)

In latest versions of Ubuntu, go to /etc/netplan 
In this directory only 1 file is present. Use vim to open this file

--> Change dhcp: no
--> addresses : []
--> gateway : 
--> nameservers:
      addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
